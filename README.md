## 🚀 Features

### 🎮 Core Gameplay
- Player name input for personalized gameplay
- Human player plays as **X**
- AI plays as **O**
- Simple and clean user interface

### 🤖 Unbeatable AI
- Implemented using the **Minimax algorithm**
- Optimized with **Alpha-Beta pruning**
- AI evaluates all possible future game states
- **AI never loses** — outcome is always **AI Win** or **Draw**

### 🧠 Explainable AI (Decision Tree)
- A **decision tree is generated for every AI move**
- Displays:
  - MAX / MIN nodes
  - Depth of each decision
  - Evaluation scores
- Helps understand **why the AI selected a particular move**

### 📜 Game History
- Stores game history during the current session
- Each entry includes:
  - Player name
  - Game result
  - Complete decision tree of that match
- History is session-based and clears on refresh

### 🏁 Accurate Result Detection
- Correctly detects:
  - Player Win
  - AI Win
  - Draw
- Winner is always evaluated **before** draw to avoid logical errors
